# Privacy Policy:

The feedback command sends feedback messages to a public channel in the bot’s support server where it also shows the feedback author’s username, channel and server.

When the bot is added to/kicked from a server it will log that with the server’s name in a private logging channel only accessible to the bot owner and support server’s staff. test

Aside from that, the bot does NOT collect any data, it merely responds to triggers.

If you wish to request a removal or copy of your data contact @demontamer on discord.
